# Umoja Games App

Umoja Games is a yearly soccer tournament for Shi'a Ithna'Asheri communities. This year, I decided to try making an app to streamline the process of figuring out when and where players are playing and to make it easier to find out about your team's standings. 

The app is currently in early development stages, with plans to complete it by mid-July (in time for testing and publishing before the games in early August).

## Building

To run this app for yourself, you'll need to have Ionic Framework installed on your computer. Head over to [Ionic's website](https://ionicframework.com) and follow the instructions to get it set up on your computer, and then run `ionic serve` in the project directory.

## Contributing

If you wish to contribute, that's great! I don't have any public roadmap or issue ticket system since I'm currently operating alone, so you should just [shoot me an email](mailto:fdatoo7@gmail.com) or send me a message on Slack if you're in the UOF thing. Great.
