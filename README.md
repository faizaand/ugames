# UGames App

UGames is a yearly soccer tournament for Shi'a Ithna'Asheri communities. This year, I decided to try making an app to streamline the process of figuring out when and where players are playing and to make it easier to find out about your team's standings. 

The app was successfully deployed and used thousands of times during the tournament.

## Building

To run this app for yourself, you'll need to have Ionic Framework installed on your computer. Head over to [Ionic's website](https://ionicframework.com) and follow the instructions to get it set up on your computer, and then run `ionic serve` in the project directory. You will need to set up the environment in `src/environments` before running. Use the example environment file as a guide.

## Contributing

If you wish to contribute, that's great! I don't have any public roadmap or issue ticket system since I'm currently operating alone, so you should just [shoot me an email](mailto:fdatoo7@gmail.com) or send me a message on Slack if you're a member of UOF.
